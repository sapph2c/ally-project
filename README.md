What is an **ally**? Roxane Gay answers this question in the article, *On Making Black Lives Matter*

> Black people do not need allies. We need people to stand up and take on the problems borne of
> oppression as their own, without remove or distance.
> We need people to do this even if they cannot fully understand what itâ€™s like to be oppressed for
> their race or ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ability, class, religion, or other marker of identity.
> We need people to use common sense to figure out how to participate in social justice. - Roxane Gay

This project serves as a guide to those wishing to become an ally to trans women.

## :ledger: Rules <a name = "rules"></a>

> Disclaimer: These are my own personal opinions on allyship for trans women, take it with a grain of salt, I am not the voice of the entire transgender community.

1. Respect people's preferred names and pronouns. This means advocating for people to use a trans woman's preferred name and pronouns when they deadname or misgender them.
2. Understand that trans women lay at the intersection between female and trans identities and experience both mysogyny and transphobia. Interrogate your relationship with mysogyny so as not to perpetuate harmful behaviors towards trans women.
3. Stay up to date with terms. Much of the language used now by trans women is very different than those who were born in the past century. Terms like transvestite are now considered derogatory and would likely offend most trans people. This will likely hold true as time progresses, so continuing your education on trans issues is critical to becoming a good ally.

### :tv: Videos <a name = "videos"></a>
- [*Gender Critical*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pTPuoGjQsI&t=7s) by Natalie Wynn. This essay deconstructs gender critical (GC) arguments while answering lay persons questions about trans femme identity. It exposes the transphobia inherent to gender critical viewpoints while also giving excellent counterpoints for allies to use when facing GC arguments.

- [*Incels*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD2briZ6fB0) by Natalie Wynn. Incels gives a broad overview of involuntary celibate culture and body dysmorphia, before connecting it to the experiences of trans women early on in their transition. It gives insight into internalized transphobia that trans women experience, as well as the harmful language used by trans women against each other.
