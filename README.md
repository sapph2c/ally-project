What is an **ally**? Roxane Gay answers this question in the article, *On Making Black Lives Matter*

> Black people do not need allies. We need people to stand up and take on the problems borne of
> oppression as their own, without remove or distance.
> We need people to do this even if they cannot fully understand what itâ€™s like to be oppressed for
> their race or ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ability, class, religion, or other marker of identity.
> We need people to use common sense to figure out how to participate in social justice. - Roxane Gay

This project serves as a guide to those wishing to become an ally to trans women.

## :speech_balloon: Dictionary <a name = "dictionary"></a>

In order to talk about issues facing trans women, it's import to have a shared common language.

| Word    | Definition |
| -------- | ------- |
| Deadname  | A transgender persons given birth name. |
| Preferred Name | The name a transgender person chooses to go by in order to align their presentation with their gender expression. |
| Preferred Pronouns | The pronouns a transgender person prefers to be called. Common examples are She/Her/Hers, He/Him/His, They/Them/Theirs. |
| Transphobia | Irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against transgender people |
| Mysogyny | Dislike of, contempt for, or ingrained prejudice against women. |
| Transmysogyny | The intersection of transphobia and misogyny as experienced by trans women and transfeminine people. |
| Intersectionality | The complex, cumulative way in which the effects of multiple forms of discrimination (such as racism, sexism, and classism) combine, overlap, or intersect especially in the experiences of marginalized individuals or groups. |

## :ledger: Rules <a name = "rules"></a>

> Disclaimer: These are my own personal opinions on allyship for trans women, take it with a grain of salt, I am not the voice of the entire transgender community.

1. Respect people's preferred names and pronouns. This means advocating for people to use a trans woman's preferred name and pronouns when they deadname or misgender them.
2. Understand that trans women lay at the intersection between female and trans identities and experience both mysogyny and transphobia. Interrogate your relationship with mysogyny so as not to perpetuate harmful behaviors towards trans women.
3. Stay up to date with terms. Much of the language used now by trans women is very different than those who were born in the past century. Terms like transvestite are now considered derogatory and would likely offend most trans people. This will likely hold true as time progresses, so continuing your education on trans issues is critical to becoming a good ally.
