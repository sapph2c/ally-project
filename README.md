What is an **ally**? Roxane Gay answers this question in the article, *On Making Black Lives Matter*

> Black people do not need allies. We need people to stand up and take on the problems borne of
> oppression as their own, without remove or distance.
> We need people to do this even if they cannot fully understand what itâ€™s like to be oppressed for
> their race or ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ability, class, religion, or other marker of identity.
> We need people to use common sense to figure out how to participate in social justice. - Roxane Gay

This project serves as a guide to those wishing to become an ally to trans woman.
